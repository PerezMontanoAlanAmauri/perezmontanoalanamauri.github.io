            <h1 class="titulo">Why the Little Frenchman Wears His Hand in a Sling</h1>

            <p>
                IT'S on my visiting cards sure enough (and it's them that's all o' pink satin paper) that inny gintleman  that  plases  may  behould  the  intheristhin  words,  "Sir  Pathrick  O'Grand Barronitt, 39 Southampton Row, Russell Square, Parrish o' Bloomsbury." And shud ye be wantin' to diskiver who is the pink of purliteness quite, and the laider of the hot tun in the houl city o' Lonon —why it's jist mesilf. And fait that same is no wonder at all at all (so be  plased  to  stop  curlin  your  nose),  for  every  inch  o'  the  six  wakes  that  been  a  gintleman,  and  left  aff  wid  the  bogthrothing  to  take  up  wid  the  Barronissy,  it's  Pathrick  that's been living like a houly imperor, and gitting the iddication and the graces. Och! and wouldn't it be a blessed thing for your spirrits if ye cud lay your two peepers jist, upon Sir Pathrick O'Grandison, Barronitt, when he is all riddy drissed for the hopperer, or stipping into the Brisky for the drive into the Hyde Park. But it's the illigant big figgur that I ave, for  the  rason  o'  which  all  the  ladies  fall  in  love  wid  me.  Isn't  it  my swate  silf  now  that'll missure the six fut, and the three inches more nor that, in me stockins, and that am excadingly will proportioned all over to match? And it is ralelly more than three fut and a bit  that  there  is,  inny  how,  of  the  little  ould  furrener  Frinchman  that  lives  jist  over  the  way, and that's a oggling and a goggling the houl day, (and bad luck to him,) at the purty widdy  Misthress  Tracle  that's  my  own  nixt-door  neighbor,  (God  bliss  her!)  and  a  most  particuller frind and acquaintance? You percave the little spalpeen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand in a sling, and it's for that same thing, by yur lave, that I'm going to give you the good rason.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The  truth  of  the  houl  matter  is  jist  simple  enough;  for  the  very  first  day  that  I  com'd  from  Connaught,  and  showd  my  swate  little  silf  in  the  strait  to  the  widdy,  who  was  looking  through  the  windy,  it  was  a  gone  case  althegither  with  the  heart  o'  the  purty  Misthress Tracle. I percaved it, ye see, all at once, and no mistake, and that's God's truth. First of all it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she threw open her two peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a little gould spy-glass that she clapped tight to one o' them and divil  may  burn  me  if  it  didn't  spake  to  me  as  plain  as  a  peeper  cud  spake,  and  says  it,  through  the  spy-glass:  "Och!  the  tip  o'  the  mornin'  to  ye,  Sir  Pathrick  O'Grandison,  Barronitt, mavourneen; and it's a nate gintleman that ye are, sure enough, and it's mesilf and  me  forten  jist  that'll  be  at  yur  sarvice,  dear,  inny  time  o'  day  at  all  at  all  for  the  asking."  And  it's  not  mesilf  ye  wud  have  to  be  bate  in  the  purliteness;  so  I  made  her  a  bow that wud ha' broken yur heart altegither to behould, and thin I pulled aff me hat with a flourish, and thin I winked at her hard wid both eyes, as much as to say, "True for you, yer a swate little crature, Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be drownthed dead in a bog, if it's not mesilf, Sir Pathrick O'Grandison, Barronitt, that'll make a houl bushel o' love to yur leddyship, in the twinkling o' the eye of a Londonderry purraty."  
            </p>
            <p>
                And it was the nixt mornin', sure, jist as I was making up me mind whither it wouldn't be the purlite thing to sind a bit o' writin' to the widdy by way of a love-litter, when up com'd the delivery servant wid an illigant card, and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver  could  rade  the  copperplate  printin  on  account  of  being  lift  handed)  was  all  about  Mounseer,  the  Count,  A  Goose,  Look  — aisy,  Maiter-di-dauns,  and  that  the  houl  of  the  divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the little ould furrener Frinchman as lived over the way.  
            </p>
            <p>
                And jist wid that in cum'd the little willian himself, and then he made me a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty of doing me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin he went on to palaver at a great rate, and divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud be afther the tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he said "pully wou,  woolly  wou,"  and  tould  me,  among  a  bushel  o'  lies,  bad  luck  to  him,  that  he  was  mad  for  the  love  o'  my  widdy  Misthress  Tracle,  and  that  my  widdy  Mrs.  Tracle  had  a  puncheon for him.  
            </p>
            <p>
                At  the  hearin'  of  this,  ye  may  swear,  though,  I  was  as  mad  as  a  grasshopper,  but  I  remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O'Grandison, Barronitt, and that it wasn't althegither gentaal to lit the anger git the upper hand o' the purliteness, so I made light o' the matter and kipt dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap, and afther a while what did he do but  ask  me  to  go  wid  him  to  the  widdy's,  saying  he  wud  give  me  the  feshionable  inthroduction to her leddyship.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Is it there ye are?" said I thin to mesilf, "and it's thrue for you, Pathrick, that ye're the fortunittest mortal in life. We'll soon see now whither it's your swate silf, or whither it's little Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in the love wid."  
            </p>
            <p>
                Wid that we wint aff to the widdy's, next door, and ye may well say it was an illigant place; so it was. There was a carpet all over the floor, and in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a Jew's harp and the divil knows what ilse, and in another corner was a sofy, the  beautifullest  thing  in  all  natur,  and  sitting  on  the  sofy,  sure  enough,  there  was  the  swate little angel, Misthress Tracle.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "The  tip  o'  the  mornin'  to  ye,"  says  I,  "Mrs.  Tracle,"  and  thin  I  made  sich  an  illigant  obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered the brain o' ye.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud," says the little furrenner Frinchman, "and sure  Mrs.  Tracle,"  says  he,  that  he  did,  "isn't  this  gintleman  here  jist  his  reverence  Sir  Pathrick  O'Grandison,  Barronitt,  and  isn't  he  althegither  and  entirely  the  most  particular  frind and acquaintance that I have in the houl world?"  
            </p>
            <p>
                And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the swatest curthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an angel; and thin, by the powers, it was that little  spalpeen  Mounseer  Maiter-di-dauns  that  plumped  his  silf  right  down  by  the  right  side of her. Och hon! I ixpicted the two eyes o' me wud ha cum'd out of my head on the spot, I was so dispirate mad! Howiver, "Bait who!" says I, after awhile. "Is it there ye are, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns?" and so down I plumped on the lift side of her leddyship, to be  aven  with  the  willain.  Botheration!  it  wud  ha  done  your  heart  good  to  percave  the  illigant double wink that I gived her jist thin right in the face with both eyes.  
            </p>
            <p>
                But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all at all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship. "Woully wou," says he, Pully wou," says he, "Plump in the mud," says he.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen," thinks I; and I talked as hard and as  fast  as  I  could  all  the  while,  and  throth  it  was  mesilf  jist  that  divarted  her  leddyship  complately  and  intirely,  by  rason  of  the  illigant  conversation  that  I  kipt  up  wid  her  all  about the dear bogs of Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate smile, from one ind of her mouth to the ither, that it made me as bould as a pig, and I jist took hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dillikitest manner in natur, looking at her all the while out o' the whites of my eyes.  
            </p>
            <p>
                And  then  ounly  percave  the  cuteness  of  the  swate  angel,  for  no  sooner  did  she  obsarve  that I was afther the squazing of her flipper, than she up wid it in a jiffy, and put it away behind  her  back,  jist  as  much  as  to  say,  "Now  thin,  Sir  Pathrick  O'Grandison,  there's  a  bitther chance for ye, mavourneen, for it's not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns."  
            </p>
            <p>
                Wid that I giv'd her a big wink jist to say, "lit Sir Pathrick alone for the likes o' them thricks," and thin I wint aisy to work, and you'd have died wid the divarsion to behould how  cliverly  I  slipped  my  right  arm  betwane  the  back  o'  the  sofy,  and  the  back  of  her  leddyship, and there, sure enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say, "the tip o' the mornin' to ye, Sir Pathrick O'Grandison, Barronitt." And wasn't it mesilf, sure, that  jist  giv'd  it  the  laste  little  bit  of  a  squaze  in  the  world,  all  in  the  way  of  a  commincement, and not to be too rough wid her leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn't it  the  gentaalest  and  dilikittest  of  all  the  little  squazes  that  I  got  in  return?  "Blood  and  thunder,  Sir  Pathrick,  mavourneen,"  thinks  I  to  mesilf,  "fait  it's  jist  the  mother's  son  of  you,  and  nobody  else  at  all  at  all,  that's  the  handsomest  and  the  fortunittest  young  bog-throtter that ever cum'd out of Connaught!" And with that I givd the flipper a big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the powers, that her leddyship giv'd to me back. But it would ha split the seven sides of you wid the laffin' to behould, jist then all at once, the consated behavior of Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o' sich a jabbering, and a smirking, and a parley-wouing as he begin'd wid her leddyship, niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn me if it wasn't me own very two peepers that cotch'd him tipping her the wink out of one eye. Och, hon! if it wasn't mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny cat I shud like to be tould who it was!  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns," said I, as purlite as iver ye seed, "that it's not the gintaal thing at all at all, and not for the likes o' you inny how, to be afther the oggling  and  a  goggling  at  her  leddyship  in  that  fashion,"  and  jist  wid  that  such  another  squaze  as  it  was  I  giv'd  her  flipper,  all  as  much  as  to  say,  "isn't  it  Sir  Pathrick  now,  my  jewel,  that'll  be  able  to  the  proticting  o'  you,  my  darlint?"  and  then  there  cum'd  another  squaze  back,  all  by  way  of  the  answer.  "Thrue  for  you,  Sir  Pathrick,"  it  said  as  plain  as  iver  a  squaze  said  in  the  world,  "Thrue  for  you,  Sir  Pathrick,  mavourneen,  and  it's  a  proper  nate  gintleman  ye  are  — that's  God's  truth,"  and  with  that  she  opened  her  two  beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha' cum'd out of her hid althegither and intirely, and  she  looked  first  as  mad  as  a  cat  at  Mounseer  Frog,  and  thin  as  smiling  as  all  out  o'  doors at mesilf.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thin," says he, the willian, "Och hon! and a wolly-wou, pully-wou," and then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of his hid was to be diskivered, and then he let down the two corners of his purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could I git out o' the spalpeen.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin, and the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the widdy; and the widdy she kept an  wid  the  squazing  of  my  flipper,  as  much  as  to  say,  "At  him  again,  Sir  Pathrick  O'Grandison, mavourneen:" so I just ripped out wid a big oath, and says I;  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun!" —and jist thin what d'ye think it was that her leddyship did? Troth she jumped up from the sofy as if she was bit,  and  made  off  through  the  door,  while  I  turned  my  head  round  afther  her,  in  a  complate  bewilderment  and  botheration,  and  followed  her  wid  me  two  peepers.  You  percave  I  had  a  reason  of  my  own  for  knowing  that  she  couldn't  git  down  the  stares  althegither and intirely; for I knew very well that I had hould of her hand, for the divil the bit had I iver lit it go. And says I; "Isn't it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that ye've been afther the making, yer leddyship? Come back now, that's a darlint, and I'll give ye yur flipper." But aff she wint down the stairs like a shot, and thin I turned round to the little Frinch furrenner. Och hon! if it wasn't his spalpeeny little paw that I had hould of in my own —why thin —thin it wasn't —that's all.  
            </p>
            <p>
                And  maybe  it  wasn't  mesilf  that  jist  died  then  outright  wid  the  laffin',  to  behold  the  little chap when he found out that it wasn't the widdy at all at all that he had had hould of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick O'Grandison. The ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he pet an! As for Sir Pathrick O'Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn't for the likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a mistake. Ye may jist say, though (for it's God's thruth), that afore I left hould of the flipper of the spalpeen (which was not till afther her leddyship's futman had kicked us both down the stairs, I giv'd it such a nate little broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Woully wou," says he, "pullywou," says he —"Cot tam!"  
            </p>
            <p>
                And that's jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a sling.  
            </p>

            <h1>Opinión Personal</h1>

            <p>
                Por qué el pequeño francés lleva la mano en cabestrillo, es un cuento corto, en el cual Sir  Patrick O’Grandison,  Baronet, es el narrador y como el titulo lo dice, nos cuenta la historia del motivo de por qué el su vecino, un pequño hombre francés lleva la mano en cabestrillo. Todo comienza por una bella dama que es viuda de la cual los dos hombres estan enamorados. Al darse cuenta de ésto el hombre francés le dice Patrick que la dama en cuestión esta enamorada de él, pero Patrick por su parte piensa que está equivocado y es de él de quien esta verdaderamente enamorada. Al tener ideas distintas, francés le dice a Patrick que fueran a la casa de la mujer y preguntarle de quien de los dos está enamorada. Patrick un hombre bastante educado y refinado, saluda a la viuda con las mas elegantes reveriencias, mientras que el francés es un poco mas vulgar en su forma de hablar y comportarse. Los dos dispuestos a cortejarla luchan cada quien a su modo por el amor de la bella dama, y uno de los actos que hacen es apretar la mano de ella y al estar casi peleando, ella salio corriendo y al hacerlos los dos hombres se dieron cuenta de que lo que realmente estaban aprendo era la mano del otro Patrick le dió un apreton de manos tan fuerte al pobre pequeño francés que le dejó la mano echa jalea y por esta razón es que lleva la mano en cabestrillo. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Es un cuento bastante corto, pero apesar de ello nos deja ver bastantes caracteristicas de los personajes, es claro que Patrick era un hombre de muy buenos modales, muy refinado y calmado, mientras que el pequeño francés se puede observar que es un hombre un tanto vulgar y maleducado, por otro lado la dama en cuestión se puede percibir alguien de igual forma que Patrick, bastante refinada y respetuosa.
