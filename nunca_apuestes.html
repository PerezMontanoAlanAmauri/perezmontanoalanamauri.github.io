            <h3 class="derecha">A TALE WITH A MORAL</h3>
            
            <p>
                "Con tal que las costumbres de un autor," says Don Thomas de las Torres, in the preface to his "Amatory Poems" "sean puras y castas, importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas  sus obras"  — meaning,  in  plain  English,  that,  provided  the  morals  of  an  author  are pure  personally,  it  signifies  nothing  what  are  the  morals  of  his  books.  We presume  that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be a clever thing,too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there until his "Amatory Poems" get out of print, or are laid definitely upon the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction shouldhave a moral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every fictionhas. Philip     Melanchthon,     some     time     ago,     wrote     a     commentary    upon     the     "Batrachomyomachia,"  and  proved  that  the  poet's  object  was  to  excite a  distaste  for  sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugohas satisfied himself  that,  by  Euenis,  Homer  meant  to  insinuate  John  Calvin;  by Antinous,  Martin  Luther;  by  the  Lotophagi,  Protestants  in  general;  and,  by  the Harpies,  the  Dutch.  Our  more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in  "The  Antediluvians,"  a  parable  in  Powhatan,"  new  views in  "Cock  Robin,"  and  transcendentalism in "Hop O' My Thumb." In short, it has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared.  A  novelist,  for  example,  need  have  no  care  of  his  moral. It  is  there  — that  is  to  say, it is somewhere —and the moral and the critics cantake care of themselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, andall that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the "Dial," or the "Down-Easter,"together with all that he ought to have intended, and the rest that he clearly meant tointend: —so that it will all come very straight in the end.  
            </p>
            <p>
                There  is  no  just  ground,  therefore,  for  the  charge  brought  against  me  by  certain ignoramuses  — that  I  have  never  written  a  moral  tale,  or,  in  more  precise words,  a  tale  with  a  moral.  They  are  not  the  critics  predestined  to  bring  me out,  and  develop  my  morals:  — that  is  the  secret.  By  and  by  the  "North American  Quarterly Humdrum" will make them ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, byway of staying execution —by way of mitigating the accusations against me —I offer thesad history appended, —a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form the title of thetale. I should have credit for this arrangement —a far wiser one than that of La Fontaineand others, who reserve the impression  to  be  conveyed  until  the  last  moment,  and  thus sneak  it  in  at  the  fag  end  of  their fables.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Defuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and De mortuis nil nisi bonum is  an  excellent  injunction  — even  if  the  dead  in  question  be  nothing  but  dead small  beer.  It  is  not  my  design,  therefore,  to  vituperate  my  deceased  friend, Toby  Dammit. He was a sad dog, it is true, and a dog's death it was that he died; but hehimself was not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his mother. Shedid her  best  in  the  way  of  flogging  him  while  an  infant  — for  duties  to  her well  regulated  mind  were  always  pleasures,  and  babies,  like  tough  steaks,  or  the modern  Greek  olive  trees, are invariably the better for beating —but, poor woman! shehad the misfortune to be left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be leftunflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a baby from left toright. If each blow in the  proper  direction  drives  an  evil  propensity  out,  it  follows that  every  thump  in  an  opposite   one   knocks   its   quota   of   wickedness   in.   I  was   often   present  Toby's   chastisements,  and,  even  by  the  way  in  which  he kicked,  I  could  perceive  that  he  was  getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw,through the tears in my eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day whenhe had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have mistaken him for alittle African, and no effect had been produced beyond that of making him wriggle himself intoa fit, I could stand it no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting myvoice, made prophecy of his ruin.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he used to get intosuch passions that he was unable to articulate. At six months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies.  At  eight  months  he  peremptorily  refused  to  put  his  signature  to  the Temperance pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until, at the close  of  the  first  year,  he  not  only  insisted  upon  wearing  moustaches,  but  had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and for backing his assertions by bets.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had predicted to Toby Dammitovertook him at last. The fashion had "grown with his growth and strengthened with hisstrength," so that, when he came to be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence withoutinterlarding it with a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers —no. I willdo my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. With him the  thing  was a  mere  formula  — nothing  more.  His  expressions  on  this  head  had  no  meaning attached  to  them  whatever.  They  were  simple  if  not  altogether  innocent  expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to round off a sentence. When he said "I'll bet  you  so and  so,"  nobody  ever  thought  of  taking  him  up;  but  still  I  could  not  help thinking it my duty to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was avulgar one —this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by society —here I saidnothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act of Congress —here I had not the slightestintention of telling a lie. I remonstrated —but to no purpose. I demonstrated —in  vain. I  entreated  — he  smiled.  I  implored  — he  laughed.  I  preached-  he  sneered.  I threatened —he swore. I kicked him —he called for the police. I pulled his nose —heblew  it,  and  offered  to  bet  the  Devil  his  head  that  I  would  not  venture  to  try that  experiment again.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Poverty  was  another  vice  which  the  peculiar  physical  deficiency  of  Dammit's  mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and this was the reason, no doubt, that hisexpletive expressions about betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to saythat I ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as "I'll bet you a dollar." It wasusually "I'll bet you what you please," or "I'll bet you what you dare," or "I'll bet you atrifle," or else, more significantly still, "I'll bet the Devil my head."  
            </p>
            <p>
                This  latter  form  seemed  to  please  him  best;  — perhaps  because  it  involved  the least  risk;  for  Dammit  had  become  excessively  parsimonious.  Had  any  one  taken  him up,  his  head  was  small,  and  thus  his  loss  would  have  been  small  too.  But  these are  my  own  reflections  and  I  am  by  no  means  sure  that  I  am  right  in attributing  them  to  him.  At  all  events the phrase in question grew daily in favor,notwithstanding the gross impropriety of  a  man  betting  his  brains  like  bank-notes:  —but  this  was  a  point  which  my  friend's  perversity of disposition would not permit himto comprehend. In the end, he abandoned all  other  forms  of  wager,  and  gave  himself  up to  "I'll  bet  the  Devil  my  head,"  with  a  pertinacity  and  exclusiveness  of  devotion that  displeased  not  less  than  it  surprised  me.  I  am  always  displeased  by circumstances  for  which  I  cannot  account.  Mysteries  force  a  man  to  think,  and  so injure  his  health.  The  truth  is,  there  was  something  in  the  air  with  which Mr.Dammit was wont to give utterance to his offensive expression —something in  his  manner of  enunciation  — which  at  first  interested,  and  afterwards  made  me  very  uneasy — something  which,  for  want  of  a  more  definite  term  at  present,  I  must  be permitted  to  call  queer;  but  which  Mr.  Coleridge  would  have  called  mystical,  Mr. Kant  pantheistical,  Mr.  Carlyle  twistical,  and  Mr.  Emerson  hyperquizzitistical.  I began  not  to  like  it  at  all.  Mr.  Dammits  soul  was  in  a  perilous  state.  I resolved  to  bring  all  my  eloquence into play to save it. I vowed to serve him as St.Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the toad, —that is to say, "awakenhim to a sense of his situation." I  addressed  myself  to  the  task  forthwith.  Once  more I  betook  myself  to  remonstrance.  Again I collected my energies for a final attempt atexpostulation.  
            </p>
            <p>
                When  I  had  made  an  end  of  my  lecture,  Mr.  Dammit  indulged  himself  in  some  very equivocal   behavior.   For   some   moments   he   remained   silent,   merely   looking   me  inquisitively  in  the  face.  But  presently  he  threw  his  head  to  one  side,  and elevated  his  eyebrows  to  a  great  extent.  Then  he  spread  out  the  palms  of  his hands  and  shrugged  up  his shoulders. Then he winked with the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut them both up very tight. Then he opened them both sovery wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, applying his thumb tohis nose, he thought  proper  to  make  an  indescribable  movement  with  the  rest  of  his fing Finally,  setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I  can  call  to  mind  only  the  beads  of  his  discourse.  He  would  be  obliged  to  me if  I  would  hold  my  tongue.  He  wished  none  of  my  advice.  He  despised  all  my insinuations.  He  was  old  enough  to  take  care  of  himself.  Did  I  still  think  him baby  Dammit?  Did  I  mean  to  say  any  thing  against  his  character?  Did  I  intend  to insult  him?  Was  I  a  fool?  Was my maternal parent aware, in a word, of my absence fromthe domiciliary residence? He  would  put  this  latter  question  to  me  as  to  a  man  of veracity,  and  he  would  bind  himself to abide by my reply. Once more he would demandexplicitly if my mother knew that  I  was  out.  My  confusion,  he  said,  betrayed  me,  and he  would  be  willing  to  bet  the  Devil his head that she did not.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he left my presence with undignified  precipitation.  It  was  well  for  him  that  he  did  so.  My  feelings  had been  wounded.  Even  my  anger  had  been  aroused.  For  once  I  would  have  taken  him up  upon  his  insulting  wager.  I  would  have  won  for  the  Arch-Enemy  Mr.  Dammit's little  head  — for  the  fact  is,  my  mamma  was  very  well  aware  of  my  merely temporary  absence  from  home.  
            </p>
            <p>
                But Khoda  shefa  midehed  — Heaven  gives  relief  — as  the  Mussulmans  say  when you  tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I had been insulted, and Ibore the  insult  like  a  man.  It  now  seemed  to  me,  however,  that  I  had  done  all that  could  be  required of me, in the case of this miserable individual, and I resolved totrouble him no longer  with  my  counsel,  but  to  leave  him  to  his  conscience  and himself.  But  although  I  forbore  to  intrude  with  my  advice,  I  could  not  bring myself  to  give  up  his  society  altogether. I even went so far as to humor some of hisless reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I found myself lauding his wickedjokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes: —so profoundly did it grieve me tohear his evil talk.  
            </p>
            <p>
                One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross it. It was roofed over, by way of protection  from  the  weather,  and  the  archway,  having  but  few  windows,  was  thus  very  uncomfortably  dark.  As  we  entered  the  passage,  the  contrast  between  the  external  glare  and the interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those of the unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped. He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively lively —so much so that I entertained I know not  what  of  uneasy  suspicion.  It  is  not  impossible  that  he  was  affected  with  the  transcendentals. I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of the "Dial"  present.  I  suggest  the  idea,  nevertheless,  because  of  a  certain  species  of  austere  Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping about under and  over  every  thing  that  came  in  his  way;  now  shouting  out,  and  now  lisping  out,  all  manner  of  odd  little  and  big  words,  yet  preserving  the  gravest  face  in  the  world  all  the  time.  I  really  could  not  make  up  my  mind  whether  to  kick  or  to  pity  him.  At  length,  having  passed  nearly  across  the  bridge,  we  approached  the  termination  of  the  footway,  when  our  progress  was  impeded  by  a  turnstile  of  some  height.  Through  this  I  made  my  way  quietly,  pushing  it  around  as  usual.  But  this  turn  would  not  serve  the  turn  of  Mr.  Dammit. He insisted upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air. Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done by Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many  words,  that  he  was  a  braggadocio,  and  could  not  do  what  he  said.  For  this  I  had  reason to be sorry afterward; —for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head that he could.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I   was   about   to   reply,   notwithstanding   my   previous   resolutions,   with   some   remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a slight cough, which sounded  very  much  like  the  ejaculation  "ahem!"  I  started,  and  looked  about  me  in  surprise.  My  glance  at  length  fell  into  a  nook  of  the  framework  of  the  briand  upon  the  figure  of  a  little  lame  old  gentleman  of  venerable  aspect.  Nothing  could  be  more  reverend  than  his  whole  appearance;  for  he  not  only  had  on  a  full  suit  of  black,  but  his  shirt  was  perfectly  clean  and  the  collar  turned  very  neatly  down  over  a  white  cravat,  while his hair was parted in front like a girl's. His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very odd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a circumstance, he interrupted me with a second "ahem!"  
            </p>
            <p>
                To  this  observation  I  was  not  immediately  prepared  to  reply.  The  fact  is,  remarks  of  this  laconic  nature  are  nearly  unanswerable.  I  have  known  a  Quarterly  Review  non-plussed  by  the  word  "Fudge!"  I  am  not  ashamed  to  say,  therefore,  that  I  turned  to  Mr.  Dammit for assistance.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Dammit," said I, "what are you about? don't you hear? —the gentleman says 'ahem!'" I  looked  sternly  at  my  friend  while  I  thus  addressed  him;  for,  to  say  the  truth,  I  felt  particularly puzzled, and when a man is particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is pretty sure to look like a fool.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Dammit,"  observed  I  — although  this  sounded  very  much  like  an  oath,  than  which  nothing was further from my thoughts —"Dammit," I suggested —"the gentleman says 'ahem!'"  
            </p>
            <p>
                I  do  not  attempt  to  defend  my  remark  on  the  score  of  profundity;  I  did  not  think  it  profound  myself;  but  I  have  noticed  that  the  effect  of  our  speeches  is  not  always  proportionate with their importance in our own eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or knocked him in the head with the "Poets and Poetry of America," he could hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those simple words: "Dammit, what are you about? —don't you hear? —the gentleman says 'ahem!'"  
            </p>
            <p>
                "You don't say so?" gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. "Are you quite sure he said that? Well, at  all  events  I  am  in  for  it  now,  and  may  as  well  put  a  bold  face  upon  the  matter.  Here  goes, then —ahem!"  
            </p>
            <p>
                At  this  the  little  old  gentleman  seemed  pleased  — God  only  knows  why.  He  left  his  station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a gracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.  
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit," said he, with the frankest of all smiles, "but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of mere form."  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ahem!"  replied  my  friend,  taking  off  his  coat,  with  a  deep  sigh,  tying  a  pocket-handkerchief   around   his   waist,   and   producing   an   unaccountable   alteration   in   his   countenance  by  twisting  up  his  eyes  and  bringing  down  the  corners  of  his  mouth  — "ahem!"  And  "ahem!"  said  he  again,  after  a  pause;  and  not  another  word  more  than  "ahem!"  did  I  ever  know  him  to  say  after  that.  "Aha!"  thought  I,  without  expressing  myself aloud —"this is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt  a  consequence  of  his  verbosity  upon  a  previous  occasion.  One  extreme  induces  another.  I  wonder  if  he  has  forgotten  the  many  unanswerable  questions  which  he  propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals."  
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ahem!"  here  replied  Toby,  just  as  if  he  had  been  reading  my  thoughts,  and  looking like a very old sheep in a revery.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade of the bridge  — a  few  paces  back  from  the  turnstile.  "My  good  fellow,"  said  he,  "I  make  it  a  point  of  conscience  to  allow  you  this  much  run.  Wait  here,  till  I  take  my  place  by  the  stile,  so  that  I  may  see  whether  you  go  over  it  handsomely,  and  transcendentally,  and  don't  omit  any  flourishes  of  the  pigeon-wing.  A  mere  form,  you  know.  I  will  say  'one,  two,  three,  and  away.'  Mind  you,  start  at  the  word  'away'"  Here  he  took  his  position  by  the  stile,  paused  a  moment  as  if  in  profound  reflection,  then  looked  up  and,  I  thought,  smiled  very  slightly,  then  tightened  the  strings  of  his  apron,  then  took  a  long  look  at  Dammit, and finally gave the word as agreed upon — 
            </p>
            <p>
                One —two —three —and —away!  
            </p>
            <p>
                Punctually at the word "away," my poor friend set off in a strong gallop. The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord's —nor yet very low, like that of Mr. Lord's reviewers, but upon  the  whole  I  made  sure  that  he  would  clear  it.  And  then  what  if  he  did  not?  — ah,  that was the question —what if he did not? "What right," said I, "had the old gentleman to  make  any  other  gentleman  jump?  The  little  old  dot-and-carry-one!  who  is  he?  If  he  asks me to jump, I won't do it, that's flat, and I don't care who the devil he is." The bridge, as  I  say,  was  arched  and  covered  in,  in  a  very  ridiculous  manner,  and  there  was  a  most  uncomfortable echo about it at all times —an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last words of my remark.  
            </p>
            <p>
                But  what  I  said,  or  what  I  thought,  or  what  I  heard,  occupied  only  an  instant.  In  less  than  five  seconds  from  his  starting,  my  poor  Toby  had  taken  the  leap.  I  saw  him  run  nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up. I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap was the affair of a moment, and, before I had a  chance  to  make  any  profound  reflections,  down  came  Mr.  Dammit  on  the  flat  of  his  back, on the same side of the stile from which he had started. At the same instant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up in his apron  something  that  fell  heavily  into  it  from  the  darkness  of  the  arch  over  the  turnstile. At all this I was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of  my  assistance.  I  hurried  up  to  him  and  found  that  he  had  received  what  might  be  termed a serious injury. The truth is, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search  I  could  not  find  anywhere;  so  I  determined  to  take  him  home  and  send  for  the  homoeopathists.  In  the  meantime  a  thought  struck  me,  and  I  threw  open  an  adjacent  window  of  the  bridge,  when  the  sad  truth  flashed  upon  me  at  once.  About  five  feet  just  above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent. With the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact.

            <p>
                He  did  not  long  survive  his  terrible  loss.  The  homoeopathists  did  not  give  him  little  enough  physic,  and  what  little  they  did  give  him  he  hesitated  to  take.  So  in  the  end  he  grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. The scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for dog's meat.

            <h1>Opinión Personal</h1>
            <p>
                Nunca apuestes tu cabeza al diablo, es un cuento con moraleja, de hecho se hace notar desde el titulo del mismo. El cuento se centra en la vida de Toby Dammit, quien era un niño que vivía en la pobreza y que desde pequeño, lo golpeaba su mamá, lo hacia tan duro que el pobre quedaba color oscuro, por los golpes que le daba. Toby se obsecionó desde muy temprana edad a las apuestas, tanto era asi que no podia completar una frase sin apostar algo, cada que hablaba siempre terminaba con un <em>te apuesto un dolar a que sí</em>, <em>te apuesto dos dolares</em>, y una frase un poco mas inusual era <em>"Le apuesto mi cabeza al diablo"</em>. Su amigo, el narrador del cuento, lo estimaba mucho y siempre le aconsejaba a ser un poco mas educado y mas correcto, y sobre todo a dejar su vicio de apostar todo el tiempo, pero al oir sus recomendaciones siempre terminaba discutiendo con el, pero aun asi siempre estaba a su lado pues le preocupaba bastante. Un día iban pasando por un puente y debian pasar sobre un molinete, Toby queria pasar saltando sobre él haciendo una piruta sobre el aire y le dijo a su amigo que le apostaba su cabeza al diablo a que pasaba sin problemas saltando. En ese momento aparece un anciano y éste alienta a Toby a saltar sobre el molinete cuando él le indicara. Cuando el anciano dió la indicación a Toby, éste salió corriendo para hacer su cometido pero justo en el lugar donde saltó se encontraba una barra de hierro con el filo horizontal, de tal forma que al saltar, el cuello de Toby fue a parar al filo de la barra cortandose así la cabeza. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Es mas que obvio que la moraleja es no apostar tu cabeza al diablo, pues al parecer en el cuento el diablo hace acto de precencia en forma de anciano, y tal parece que tiene todo planeado y éste incita a Toby a saltar y reclamar así su cabeza.
